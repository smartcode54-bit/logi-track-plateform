# logitrack-api

Go backend for the LogiTrack migration off Firebase (`mv-go`). Design: [`developer-spec.md`](../developer-spec.md) §2, routes in [Appendix B](../shared-docs/specs/mv-go/B-api-catalog.md). Branch policy: work lands by PR into `mv-go`, never `main` (R90).

Status: **T01 scaffold + T02 local stack**. One module, seven binaries, shared `internal/`; no domain routes yet.

## Layout

```
cmd/api          two HTTP listeners (internal + public) and /metrics
cmd/worker       background consumers (T10); today: /metrics + wait for SIGTERM
cmd/scheduler    cron + outbox relay (T10); today: /metrics + wait for SIGTERM
cmd/migrate      goose migrations (T03)        — exits 3 until implemented
cmd/seed         seed profiles (T16)           — exits 3 until implemented
cmd/etl          Firestore/GCS → PG/MinIO (T15) — exits 3 until implemented
cmd/release      APK publish CLI (T52)         — exits 3 until implemented
internal/app                 process wiring, configs, API server, graceful shutdown
internal/platform/config     env loading: all missing/invalid names in one error, never values
internal/platform/logx       zerolog + redacting writer (authorization, password, *token, cookie, idCard, ...)
internal/platform/httpx      envelopes, error codes, request id, client IP, access log
internal/platform/ingress    route groups and the public allow-list
internal/platform/health     /healthz, /readyz, /startupz, drain state
internal/platform/telemetry  OpenTelemetry (OTLP/HTTP) and Prometheus
```

## Listeners (main spec §2.6)

| Listener | Env | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| internal | `API_INTERNAL_ADDR` | every route group, incl. `/readyz`, `/startupz` |
| public | `API_PUBLIC_ADDR` | only groups marked public **and** listed in `PUBLIC_ROUTE_GROUPS` (subset of `/v1/mobile`, `/v1/auth`, `/public/v1`, `/evidence`, `/healthz`); everything else `404 not_found` |
| metrics | `METRICS_ADDR` | `GET /metrics` (Prometheus), private |

`X-Forwarded-For` is honoured only when the TCP peer is inside `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`; the header is walked right to left and the first untrusted hop is the client. `X-Act-On-Tenant` is refused on the public listener (`400 header_not_allowed`).

Errors are always `{"error":{"code","message","details","requestId"}}` and `requestId` equals the `X-Request-Id` response header. Success bodies are `{"data": ...}`. JSON is camelCase.

## Environment (names only; values live in the secret store, main spec §16)

| Name | Processes | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `APP_ENV` | all | yes | — (`local`, `dev`, `prod`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_FORMAT` | all | no | `info`, `json` (`console` for local) |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` | all | no | export off, `logitrack-<process>`, `1` |
| `METRICS_ADDR` | api, worker, scheduler | yes | — |
| `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | api, worker, scheduler | no | `30s` |
| `API_INTERNAL_ADDR`, `API_PUBLIC_ADDR` | api | yes | — |
| `PUBLIC_ROUTE_GROUPS` | api | no | all five public groups |
| `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS` | api | no | none (no `X-Forwarded-For` trusted) |

A missing or invalid variable stops the process with exit code 2 and a message naming every offending variable (never its value). Startup logs list each variable as `set`/`unset`.

## Lifecycle

`SIGTERM` → `/readyz` answers `503 unavailable` (`details.reason=draining`) → after a grace of `min(5s, SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT/3)` both listeners stop accepting and in-flight requests drain within the rest of `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` → exit 0. `/healthz` stays 200 until the listener closes.

Exit codes: `0` ok, `1` runtime error, `2` configuration error, `3` not implemented yet.

## Local stack (T02, main spec §15)

```bash
make env
```

```bash
make dev-keys
```

```bash
make up
```

```bash
make smoke
```

- `make env` writes `.env` (mode 0600, gitignored) from `.env.example`: secret names get random local-only values and the three DB URLs are composed for the R66 roles. Integration credentials stay blank, so FCM, LINE, Cartrack, Google and the SMTP relay are off locally (mail goes to mailpit).
- `make dev-keys` writes `deploy/dev-secrets/jwt-ed25519.pem` (gitignored) and sets `JWT_ACTIVE_KID` (RFC 7638 thumbprint).
- `make up` starts PostgreSQL 18, Redis 7, RabbitMQ 4 (+ definitions from `internal/platform/mq`), MinIO (+ buckets), mailpit, api, worker and scheduler, sets the role passwords (`make dev-db`) and waits until all are healthy. Profiles: `tools` (migrate, seed, etl), `mocks` (WireMock), `obs` (Jaeger), `tunnel`; `EDGE=1` adds web and Caddy once TW2 lands.
- `make smoke` checks the T02 acceptance criteria against the running stack.

| Service | Host port (127.0.0.1) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| postgres | 5432 | PGDATA `/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker`, volume at `/var/lib/postgresql`; roles from `deploy/postgres-init/00-roles.sql`; `logitrack_test` for integration tests |
| redis | 6379 | AOF, `noeviction` |
| rabbitmq | 5672, 15672 | 5 exchanges, 16 work queues, 16 `.dead` queues, 5 retry queues |
| minio | 9000, 9001 | `S3_BUCKET` private; `S3_PUBLIC_BUCKET` anonymous GET on `app_releases/` only; app user limited to both buckets |
| mailpit | 8025, 1025 | SMTP sink |
| api | 8080, 8081 | internal and public listeners (local only; Caddy fronts public from TW2) |

Each Go service receives exactly the §16.1 names whose consumer column lists it: api, worker and scheduler see only `DATABASE_URL`; seed sees all three DB URLs. `make env-check` verifies `.env.example` and the compose environments against `developer-spec.md` §16; `make secrets-scan` runs gitleaks over the files git would commit.

MinIO: the official `minio/minio` and `minio/mc` images are no longer published, so compose uses Chainguard's source builds (`cgr.dev/chainguard/minio`, `cgr.dev/chainguard/minio-client:latest-dev`) pinned by digest. Any S3-compatible server can replace it later; only the `S3_*` values change.

## Develop

Go `1.27` with `toolchain go1.27.2` (stdlib security fixes; the go command downloads it automatically).

```bash
go test -race ./...
```

```bash
go run github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest run ./...
```

```bash
go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest ./...
```

Run the api locally (any free ports):

```bash
APP_ENV=local LOG_FORMAT=console API_INTERNAL_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8080 API_PUBLIC_ADDR=127.0.0.1:8081 METRICS_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9090 go run ./cmd/api
```

CI for `mv-go` arrives with T14.
